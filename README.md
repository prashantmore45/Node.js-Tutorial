## ‚ú® Overview

This repository serves as a practical, example-driven tutorial for mastering Node.js. It moves beyond theoretical concepts by providing several **mini-projects** and dedicated folders for understanding core modules.

The goal is to build a solid foundation in backend development using Node.js, covering essential topics required to build real-world applications.

---

## üéØ What You Will Learn

This tutorial covers:

* **Core Modules:** Practical usage of built-in Node.js modules like `http` and `events`.
* **Module Systems:** Implementing and understanding both **CommonJS (`require`)** and **ES Modules (`import`)**.
* **Asynchronous Programming:** Handling asynchronous operations effectively (e.g., callbacks, Promises, `async/await`).
* **API Development:** Building and structuring APIs (using Express.js or the native HTTP module).
* **Database Integration:** Connecting and performing CRUD operations with a database.
* **Backend Application Development:** Architectural patterns and best practices for creating scalable backend applications.

## üìÇ Projects and Examples

The repository is organized into distinct folders for both foundational concepts and mini-projects.

### Mini-Projects

|         Folder Name                  |                               Description                           |      Concepts Covered    |
|            :---                      |                                   :---                              |                 :---      | 
| `miniProject01` to `miniProject05`   | A series of small, focused applications demonstrating key features. | Routing, middleware, basic API design, data handling. |
| `URL_Shortener_Project`              | A complete, larger application to shorten URLs.                     | Database design, unique ID generation, redirection, and full-stack application structure. |

### Core Concept Examples

| Folder Name   |                             Description                                  |                   Focus Area                       |

|   `Modules`   | Examples demonstrating how to create, export, and import custom modules. |        **CommonJS** (`require/module.exports`).    |
|  `ESmodule`   | Demonstrations of the modern ES module system in Node.js.                |              **ESM** (`import/export`).            |
| `HTTP_Module` | Hands-on examples of creating a basic web server using the native Node.js HTTP module. | **Networking**, **Server creation**. |
|    `Events`   | Illustrations of the `EventEmitter` class for handling custom events and asynchronous tasks. | **Event-driven architecture**. |
